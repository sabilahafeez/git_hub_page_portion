                    <p>BeeWare started about four years because I wanted a debugger for my Python code.I grew up
                        learning to
                        code using the Borland suite of tools (Turbo C, Turbo Pascal and so on). Since it was the late
                        80s,
                        they were all console based but they had a really good editor and debugger built in.</p>

                    <p>I first started poking around Kubernetes in August 2016. Writing backend Go was something I had
                        done in the past few years, and I always love new technology and exciting communities. It was a
                        natural fit, and as soon as I found something I could help out with, the commits just started
                        flowing!</p>

                    <p>I started Vue as a personal project when I was working at Google Creative Labs in 2013. My job
                        there involved building a lot of UI prototypes. After hand-rolling many of them with vanilla
                        JavaScript and using Angular 1 for a few, I wanted something that captured the declarative
                        nature of Angular’s data binding, but with a simpler, more approachable API.</p>

                    <p>I was already familiar with Docker, but I opened my first pull request on July 9th, 2014. It was
                        to fix some duplicate IP tables rules. After joining the company and contributing more, I became
                        a maintainer.</p>
